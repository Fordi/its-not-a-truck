# Tubes (a sort puzzle)

This is my attempt at the basic sort puzzle game.

Implemented:

* Tubes!
* Fluid!
* Undo!
* Reset!
* Animations!

To do:

* Responding to "too many tubes on screen"!
* Maintaining the current level in local storage!
* Buttons to shift the level back and forth!
* HUD styling!
* "You Won!" message!
* Detection of "no more moves" state!

Not to do:

* Ads!  Fuck ads!
